### Testimonials - Amazon Affiliates Love Us ######

We've made an impact since launching the first version of AMZ Watcher some years ago. AMZ Watcher is, in our opinion, the best Amazon Affilaite WordPress plugin. Don't just take our word for it though:

"AMZ Watcher is a smart tool. Takes a 6 hour task and reduces it to 6 seconds." - Matt Diggity, Diggity Marketing

"AMZ Watcher is a great tool. Not many people realize how many of their affiliate links are broken, or don’t even have an affiliate ID attached.Not only that, many products become unavailable and you end up leaving money on the table by linking your users to products that aren’t for sale, making them leave Amazon without a purchase. Amzwatcher makes it pretty easy to fix all of this and save a lot of time in the process.We have it monitoring most of our sites now and regularly find broken links, so it’s a big time saver and money maker." - Dom Wells, onfolio.io and ex-HumanProofDesigns

"After I had fixed my broken links, I started seeing a lot more sales from the products I was promoting. Even though the clicks remained steady, the number of orders and earning increased." - Ben Adler, Affiliate Niche Builder

== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

= Is AMZ Watcher truly free? =

Yes! AMZ Watcher is a freemium software provided to anyone looking to optimize their affiliate site. The free version includes broken links reports for some pages of your site. If you would like to get full reports, please upgrade.

=How often are my links checked?=

AMZ Watcher gives you different options: you can pick how often you want your links checked. Currently it is possible to check your links from once every 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days. This setting will have an effect on how fast you are using up your page credits.

=How do page credits work?=

Page credit system is something AMZ Watcher uses to measure your account usage. One page credit equals to AMZ Watcher going to a single page on your site or on Amazon.
Every time AMZ Watcher does a site check, it does a full crawl of your site and then checks all the pages on Amazon you link out to.

Consider this scenario:
Your site has 100 pages with 50 commercial(money) pages and 5 links to unique products on Amazon on average.
This makes a total of 100 site pages + 250 unique Amazon product pages AMZ Watcher needs to check to do a full scan. These 350 pages are equal to 350 credits that are spent on a single crawl.
Monitoring this site once a week will cost you 1400 credits per month just for this site.

=Do you have a daily page check limit?=

No, we do not have a daily page check limit. Our tool works great with sites of all sizes, from 10 page niche sites to 20,000+ pages large authority sites.

=How long do you keep my data?=

Historical data is kept for one year.

=I just want to use AMZ Watcher once to find invalid links. Is it possible?=

Yes. You’re free to take a subscription just for one month and cancel your account when your work is done. Note, when cancelling your account, you will lose access to all your data until you re-subscribe again.

=Does AMZ Watcher register clicks in my Amazon Associates Dashboard?=

AMZ Watcher does not “click” any clicks, so the link checking we do is not registered in your amazon affiliate dashboard. We split any identifying information like affiliate id and link id from your links and this does not create clicks on amazon’s end.

=How can I upgrade my plan?=

Select the desired subscription plan from the Pricing page and follow the steps to upgrade. Depending on your current plan and its prepaid period, you’ll only pay the prorated amount in the first payment for the new plan.

= Is AMZ Watcher compatible with WordPress multisite? =

AMZ Watcher is compatible with WordPress multisite, but it allows connection to only one website crawl reports at a time.

= What support is provided? =

Limited free support is provided, and we offer dedicated priority email and live chat support for our AMZ Watcher users.

= Where can I find out about the pricing of AMZ Watcher? =
